    <p id="info">Playing video games has become a popular activity for people of all ages. Video gaming is a multibillion-dollar industry bringing in more money than movies and DVDs. While some games have educational content, many of the most popular games emphasize negative themes such as racial, sexual, and gender stereotypes, the killing of people or animals, and sexual exploitation and violence toward women. Violent video games provide a forum for learning and practicing aggressive solutions to conflict situations. Children and adolescents can easily become overly involved with videogamesby spending excessive time playing them. They may have difficulty controlling the amount of time they play. Studies of children overly exposed to violent media have shown that they may become numb to violence, imitate the violence, and show more aggressive behavior. A number of experiments show that even adults feel more hostile after playing violent gamesâ€“especially games that simulate real-life situations. There is also evidence that playing violent games can make people behave more aggressively immediately afterwards. Younger children and those with emotional, behavioral or learning problems may be more influenced by violent images.</p>
