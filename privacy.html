    <p id="info">Unlike Facebook and Instagram, you're free to watch TikTok videos without registering, which means no data collection. However, if you want to create a video and share it, or comment on someone's video, then you must fork over your personal information, starting with age, phone number and e-mail address.From there, TikTok freely admits – in the privacy policy on its website – it collects information shared from third-party social network providers, and technical (your location) and behavioral information (what videos you think are funny, how often you watch) about your use of the Platform. They also collect information contained in the messages you send through our Platform and information from your phone book. The information collected by TikTok is similar to what's gathered by Facebook, but security researcher Patrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of security app Disconnect, says Facebook does more ill things with it, simply because it's so much bigger. Facebook boasts of over 2 billion users. In the 2010s, personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected without their consent by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, predominantly to be used for political advertising. The risk of online predators using information leaked from social media to reach users generates a new danger in today's age. The possibilities of the user receiving physical harm due to the loss of privacy is extremely dangerous.</p>
