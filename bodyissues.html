    <p id="info">Our society has extremely unrealistic beauty standards and this is due to the emergence and popularity of social media. With all the different applications for photo editing and all sorts of filters available online, it has become easier and simpler than ever before to take that perfect and flawless selfie. It only takes a few seconds to achieve that beautiful makeup, unblemished skin, and gorgeous hair. Unfortunately, in recent years, photo-editing has become an unhealthy and damaging obsession for some people – and those that look up to them. While traditional media has photo editing for the longest time, it is only just recently that it has become more accessible and available for everyone. Today, in just a matter of clicks, you are able to easily change your appearance – sometimes way beyond recognition.  An increasing number of individuals with a dysmorphic disorder has begun to appear, due to the newfound obsession with our appearance. This disorder occurs when a person gets preoccupied with an imagined physical imperfection and he or she will do anything to change it. These photo-editing apps enable this behavior, because it allows these vulnerable victims to become dependent on editing their appearance in order to feel happy with the way they look. This is a two-fold problem. This behavior is not only dangerous to the person who edits their own pictures - but it can also harm the person that consumes that image. This forms an unattainable and unrealistic ideal of beauty that can fuel a sense of inadequacy for an entire generation.</p>
